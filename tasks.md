## Identified Issues and Required Fixes

### Analysis Pipeline Issues
1. **Data Dependencies**
   - Issue: Analysis steps don't properly validate required data from previous steps
   - Fix: Add data validation and dependency checks
   - Files: `src/pages/AnalysisPipelinePage.tsx`

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Issue: Progress tracking doesn't account for failed steps
   - Fix: Implement proper error states and progress rollback
   - Files: `src/pages/AnalysisPipelinePage.tsx`

3. **Agent State Management**
   - Issue: Agent states are not properly persisted between page reloads
   - Fix: Implement proper state persistence and recovery
   - Files: `src/lib/ai/*-agent.ts`

### Problem Understanding Issues
1. **Context Management**
   - Issue: Problem context loading can be slow and cause UI flicker
   - Fix: Implement proper loading states and caching
   - Files: `src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`

2. **Question Flow**
   - Issue: Question flow is too rigid with fixed number of follow-ups
   - Fix: Implement dynamic question generation based on context
   - Files: `src/lib/ai/openai-agent.ts`

## Pending Tasks
