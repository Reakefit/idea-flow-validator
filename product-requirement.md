## Vision
InsightValidator empowers founders to transform raw ideas into validated opportunities in a single, coherent journey—no more scattered tools or endless spreadsheets. From one conversational chat to a fully integrated Dashboard, founders will:

- **Articulate** their problem clearly.  
- **Receive** deep, automated analyses spanning market size, competitor landscapes, feature gaps, customer pain points, strategic opportunities, and persona profiles.  
- **Schedule** real interviews, capture live insights with an AI coach, and immediately generate per‑conversation summaries.  
- **Review** consolidated findings to launch an action‑able MVP roadmap.

We envision InsightValidator as the entrepreneur's co‑founder in code—streamlining validation, boosting confidence, and accelerating product‑market fit.
